## Introduction
clientpoker is a decentralized online poker platform where the shuffling and dealing of cards are directly calculated and determined by the client, not by the server. It can also be said that **clientpoker** is an implementation of **Mental poker**. It is the most transparent, fairest, provable, and decentralized poker game in the world.

## About Me
I love playing online Texas Hold'em, but I hate the cheating behavior of companies that operate online poker games. It can be said with certainty that almost all online poker games are rigged by the companies that operate them. This is why I developed this project: to completely eliminate any form of cheating and fraud. Unlike traditional online poker, **clientpoker** is completely calculated and determined by the client itself for shuffling and dealing cards, without relying on the server. The server has become a thin version with only communication function. I hope everyone likes this project.

## Roadmap
The clientpoker project is currently under development, using HTML + JavaScript + CSS to implement the client-side. All the logic for shuffling and dealing cards is handled entirely by the client, you simply need to double-click the `index.html` file to run it in your browser on your local machine. The server is also being developed simultaneously, focusing solely on communication functionalities and containing no code related to shuffling or dealing cards.
