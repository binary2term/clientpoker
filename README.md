## Intro
clientpoker is a decentralized online poker platform where the shuffling and dealing of cards are directly calculated and determined by the client, not by the server. It can also be said that **clientpoker** is an implementation of **Mental poker**.

## About Me
I love playing online Texas Hold'em, but I hate the cheating behavior of companies that operate online poker games. It can be said with certainty that almost all online poker games are rigged by the companies that operate them. This is why I developed this project: to completely eliminate any form of cheating and fraud. Unlike traditional online poker, **clientpoker** is completely calculated and determined by the client itself for shuffling and dealing cards, without relying on the server. The server has become a thin version with only communication function. I hope everyone likes this project.
